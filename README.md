## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I have mainly learned the use of "media queries", an aspect I had not yet worked on. It has also helped me to delve into "flexbox".

### Continued development

For the next project I would like to try to work with grids.
